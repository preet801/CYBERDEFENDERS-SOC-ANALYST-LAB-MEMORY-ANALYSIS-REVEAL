CYBERDEFENDERS-SOC-ANALYST-LAB-MEMORY-ANALYSIS-REVEAL

OBJECTIVE OF THE LAB:

You are a forensic investigator at a financial institution, and your SIEM flagged unusual activity on a workstation with access to sensitive financial data. Suspecting a breach, you received a memory dump from the compromised machine. Your task is to analyze the memory for signs of compromise, trace the anomaly's origin, and assess its scope to contain the incident effectively.
